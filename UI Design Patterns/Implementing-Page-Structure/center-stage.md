# Center stage

- Central area for carrying out action and operations(focal point)
  - while other panels, toolsets are available
- Put the most important information, or frequently used panel center stage
  - draw users' attention
- never allow a user to freeze at your design decision
- Be wary of user's frustrations
- test your design early with users


## Best Practice

- Find the most important part of the UI
- Make it the largest and make all other smaller
  - about twice as large
- Use color to separate the content of the UI from the UI itself
  - like white on grey background
- use headline to distinguish other panels from one another
- arrange the different elements to the users' expectations
  - but should help the user carry out their action as quickly as possible
  - don't hide expected features
