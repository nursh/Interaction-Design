# What are we designing

- We are designing to help users in their lives(intervention)
  - understand broader perspective of problem
  - understand what the users need

- We are designing interactions not just interfaces
  - nature of interaction changes with environment
    - online vs in person
  - technology changes interaction
- Intervention is not just an artifact(website, product etc.)
  - you're changing a system, relationships
- The way you describe things matter
  - Ratner - diamond story -> Selling crap
  - it's far more than the artifact
- Leave a difference for the good of your users behind
