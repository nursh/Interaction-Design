# Users at the heart of design

- use research to see what your users need
- create a prototype and share with users


- What is needed
  - what does the user want
  - understand the situation
  - interview them
  - view documentation
  - observe directly or indirectly
  - ethnography
  - What is there already? vs What is wanted?

- Analysis
  - actionable knowledge
  - scenarios -> single stories
  - task analysis
    - what somebody might do
    - details

- Design
  - guidelines
  - accessibility
  - principles(CRAP)
  - design notations
  - feedback

- Prototype
  - evaluation from users
  - feedback on design

- cyclic design(iterations)
  - between the 4 earlier stages after getting feedback

- Technology Probe
  - the first time something is designed(users don't know what the tech is)

- Implement and deploy
  - specifications (precise)
  - exactly what you're delivering
  - architectures
    - choices
  - documentation
  - help systems
    - what happens when the user needs help

- communicate your decisions clearly
  - else someone will make them for you
