## User focus

- Actively engage with users
- don't just ask users what they want
- Who are our users
  - where are they(context)
  - details in their life
  - what do they do
- you cannot fully understand people
- they are not like you
  - try to understand what's in their head
  - not what you put there
  - you need to talk to them
  - how do they think
  - what are their desires
  - watch them
    - expert behaviors(things you can't explain)
  - use your imagination
  - use secondary sources



## Make users with real personas

- Focus on users as individuals
  - focus on abilities, goals in using products and focus
- Persona -> rich description of a user
  - an example of a user
- Usually have several personas
- What would X think?
  - What would X do?
  - how would X feel?
- Details matter here
- understand character of persona
- look at demographics
  - age
  - sex
  - education
  - family
  - disability
- think about the person, they are not just data
  - how does the data affect their behaviour
  - have rich human understanding to create better design
- Real to your user, developers, designers
- Have the absolute average user
- Make sure to cover the range
- Design for as wide a range of user abilities as possible(always)
- personas as representing needs and behaviours rather than physical characteristics
  - not always true



## Cultural Probes

- cultural probes
  - how people experience and feel their environment

- the bag(experience)
  - let them document what they want
- get a sense of what it means to be your user
- create user scene(crime scene) with information



## Technology Probes

- learn how users use a technology
- design a prototype but is not an early version of what you want to design
- see how users interact and what they desire
