# Storytelling with scenarios

- Personas are what people are like
- Scenarios are about how people do things
  - validate other kinds of models
- Create a step-by-step walkthrough
  - what can I do?
  - What are the steps?
    - how can they step through the system
  - What are they thinking
  - What can they see
- Scenarios are about capturing what users
  - are doing
  - could do
  - might want to do
- dig into details
- validate other models
- express dynamics
- scenarios are linear
  - concrete
  - easy to understand
- less likely to make errors and mistakes when design is concrete
  - as opposed to abstract
- scenarios can miss branches
  - but multiple scenarios help
-
