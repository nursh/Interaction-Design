# What is design

- Design is to plan something in advance
  - achieve goals within constraints
- Constraints are critical
  - medium
  - computers and devices
  - time and money
- Constraints force you to make choices and trade-offs
  - can't achieve all goals
  - have to pick what's important
- material used changes nature of design
  - mobile to web design is bad
- materials are:
  - platform
  - computer
  - screen size
  - people(rship between other people and materials)
- Fundamental capacities of materials
- understand nature of people
- Know how your materials fail and design for that
  - understand limitations of people as actors in your system
  - design for when those limitations and mistakes happen
- Treat users as well as your material
