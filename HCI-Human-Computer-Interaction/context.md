# Context

- Focus on the wider context of design
  - not just on the platform(phone, web) you're designing for
- We interact with people
- we design with the body in mind
  - physical environment(distance)
    - noisy or quiet
    - hot or cold
- keep the whole context
- sketch things(environment) and how users will interact with designed product
  - not just wireframe
  - photograph people
  - where is the design being used
- make mock-up and play-act with it
  - act your design out
  - you will see errors and how it will work
