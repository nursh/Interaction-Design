# Design for other cultures

- cultures differ
  - like language
- Localization(internationalization)
  - taking an interface and making it appropriate for a particular place(locale or culture)
  - change depending in the place used
- Globalization
  - works for everybody everywhere
- elements of both localization and globalization
- left to right order
- more than language
  - cultural assumptions
  - meanings of symbols
- there is a subtle understanding of things
  - find someone who richly understands their culture
