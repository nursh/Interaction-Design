# Alignment

- Be aware of your users language
  - left to right(ltr) vs right to left(rtl)
  - align according to the language to make it easy for them
    - left aligned for left to right
    - right aligned for right to left

- why is somebody scanning the text? Think purpose
  - will determine the alignment
  - when people are searching for names
    - are they looking by first name or last name
    - align the most important thing(what they're searching for) first(if ltr language, left align it and vice versa for rtl)

  - numbers
    - think purpose
    - alignment on decimal points(look like histogram) vs right aligned
    - why are they looking at numbers
    - using leader lines or dots to attach rows of text to numbers
      - like book chapters to their page number but on a table
      - or alternating colors for rows
      - use light lines to separate each row
    - use with caution:
      - use bad alignment, right align text field
