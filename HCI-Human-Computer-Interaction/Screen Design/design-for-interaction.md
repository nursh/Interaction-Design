# Design for interaction

- What is active and what is passive
- What can the user interact with
  - is there any sign(obvious)
- What is used for display and what can be edited
- Use consistent styling for interactive elements
  - getting it wrong can make the ui unusable
- look around other applications to know how to apply design
- state-based names vs action-based names
  - be consistent
- think about what things mean
  - like bold
    - does it mean make the following text bold
    - or make the previous text bold
- Ecology Pyschology term - Affordance
  - the appearance of features in an environment and what it allows you to do
    - like push plates on doors
    - handles on cups
  - make digital design have a pointer to the real world designs
    - let it remind users of the real thing
  - some actions are learned
    - like the menu button(hamburger)

- The purpose of information matters
  - this will affect how it is represented
  - primary purpose
- Think of interactivity when designing
  - and how it can affect the data shown
  - soften the choice and make it easy for comparison
- second-order trade-off
  - give choice back to the user(interactivity of some kind)
  - but don't overdo it
-
