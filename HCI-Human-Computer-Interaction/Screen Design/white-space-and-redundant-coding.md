# White space and Redundant coding

- White space is critical in page design
  - not saying things can be used as emphasis
- Kerning -> spacing between letters
  - especially between A and V, and letters like i and l
  - it could cause problems like not knowing the difference between words
- use spacing to structure to your document
  - to add hierarchy
  - to highlight something

- Use redundancy for your design
  - color
  - fonts
  - spacing
- for graphical elements, to divide groups
  - after adding spacing, add some type of faint line or background color
  - not always appropriate
- Think, is this the only way to do what I'm doing
  - can someone interpret this differently
  - color blind, autistic etc.
