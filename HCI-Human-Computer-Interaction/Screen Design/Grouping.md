# Grouping to organize your screen design

- use proximity to arrange elements on your screen
  - structure things to make sense to the user(make sense as a unit)
  - exception to rule: be explicit if things are off the screen and are considered essential
  - cake recipe syndrome - think about the order in which you place things
    - the user might click things before they need to
  - use boxes, lines, background colors, text color for grouping
