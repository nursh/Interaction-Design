# Iterative Prototyping (not always the solution)

- Start with something and iterate to get things better
  - iterative design
- hill climbing analogy to iterative design
  - local high points vs global high points
    - starting at England mountain vs Alps vs K2 vs Everest
    - Malvern Hills vs Matterhorn(higher climb)
  - if you start in the wrong place, you will not end up far
  - the start point matters
    - if you start at a good point, your design will be better
    - because you are iteratively becoming better
  - start with lots and lots of design
    - and play with them
    - then throw the bad ones
  - Always start with good design

- Ask yourself, "Am I in the right place?"
