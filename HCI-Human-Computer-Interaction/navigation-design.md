# Help Users Realize their Goals: Navigation Design

- How users find their way in an application
  - involves levels of details
- Levels of design and structure
  - screen design(screen level) / page design / individual screen -> within
  - application level -> global
  - multi-page design
  - wider context -> interaction with other apps maybe cloud
- Think of wider context
  - back button relative to current page
  - individual controls
  - buttons might have different modes



## rules of navigation

- knowing where you are
- knowing what you can do next
- knowing where your are going(or what will happen)
- knowing where you've been(or what you've done)



## Local Navigation - Current page

- what can i do from here
  - where can I go
- How do you design a page so that the user finds it easy to get to their goal
  - using the rules of navigation
  - using BreadCrumbs etc
- The big button trap
  - big picture and one or two words
  - instead of using vague terms
    - add a little bit of extra text to show where you're going to next
- knowing where you are, relative to where you want to be
  - scent of information
  - scent is getting stronger



## Use Modes and Modal Interfaces

- Modes
  - when the meaning of an action(user action) depends on the state
  - where the state of the system changes the interpretation of an action, that is a mode
    - this is what creates confusion
  - mode is crucial but creates confusion
    - make sure user is aware of context else they will do something wrong
- Make it obvious to users
- Good feedback to users in a mode is essential
  - especially if the mode is destructive
  - eg delete mode should have multiple cues
- exiting a mode should be obvious to users
  - like closing a dialog or click a well labelled button
- printer example
  - normal mode
  - standby mode
- voice control example
  - alexa, do something
  - don't perform actions until a certain mode is activated
- screen/application example
  - mute/unmute
- keyboard
  - Shift key as caps 
- modes make a difference



## Global Navigation

- ways to think about
  - Top-Down view(Hierarchical)
  - order of the way things are done(network)
- Mega menu can be the fastest thing to do
- Dialog Design
  - how you design order of interaction between user and the computer


## Dialog

- interaction between user and computer
- use terms that the users are familiar with
- There is a generic pattern
  - choice points change interaction path
