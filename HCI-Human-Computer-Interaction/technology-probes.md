# Technology Probes

- share design ideas
  - see if we understood design problem
  - determine whether adjustments are needed

- What is visible to the user is not necessarily what is on the computer
- prototype triggers concrete conversation 
  - abstract concepts might not be understood fully
  - show them a concrete example and get proper feedback
- talk to people in their context(environment of use)
  - they will have better answers
- get how and where the product will be used
  - then alter your designs
