# Understand the wider picture

- Applications and websites are designed in an ecosystem(wider context)
  - they must work together with other things and satisfy rules and protocols
  - iOS, android etc
- be consistent with styles
  - be aware of the context design
  - it should be a design choice
- What are the platform standards
- What are other applications doing
- There are function issues(consistent with system)
  - shortcuts -> copy and paste
  - how the user interacts with elements in your system
  - linking to other applications(like scanning barcode)
  - embeddable applications
