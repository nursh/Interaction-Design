# How to write perfect introduction to UX case study

- Introduction should have 3 main components
  - a design problem that involves a business need
  - your approach to solving the problem
  - your role in the project
- It should be about 4 - 5 sentences long


## 3 Essential Components of your case study

- Problem Statement
  - key problem you're going to solve preferably in business objectives or metrics
  - What motivates you to solve this problem
  - What are your thoughts and feelings about it
- Your solution
  - what approach did you use to solve the problem
  - Give readers a taste of what to expect at the end of the story
  - What deliverable or final output will you produce
- Your role
  - how did you contribute to the project
  - the role should be linked to the job you apply for


## How to write a problem statement

- explain what you're trying to solve with a strong motivation and the main challenge involved
  - I wanted to [solve this problem], because [of my motivations]. This problem is particularly challenging since [describe my main challenge].
- Tie it to a business problem whenever possible
  - people hire you to bring value to a business
  - with business value
    - We launched a feature ‘X’ 2 months ago, but realized that many people were not using it because they didn’t know it even existed. I wanted to increase its discoverability, because ‘X’ will help open a new stream of revenue for our app.
  - without business value
    - I set out to do a complete visual overhaul of the Podcast App so that it looks fresh and provides an exciting user experience.
  - the problem statement rewritten with business value
    - The Podcast App is a leading podcast app, but its design looks outdated compared to its competitors. With such tight competition in the industry, a visual overhaul is long overdue. I thus set out to reimagine the Podcast App so it can maintain its lead in the years to come.
- personal motivation also works as a value
  - working on a project that caused you problems
- show your humanity in your problem statement
  - were you anxious to do the project


## How to write your solution

- Mention key deliverables of the project
- Give the readers a taste of what to expect
  - don't fully explain what you did 
- Briefly explain the design process you used
- Example
  - We ran 2 weeks of design sprints based on the design thinking methodology, which includes 5 stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. We eventually created and shipped a fully functional app where people can learn English in as little as 15 minutes a day.


## How to write about your role in the project

- clearly state your role
  - what you contributed and what you didn't contribute
- have a balance of I and We in the project
  - present as a team player
  - but be clear about what you bring to the table
- Give credit to who helped along
- example
  - I conducted initial user research and defined key personas, and also helped evaluate our designs through usability tests before it was launched. The amazing Victor Johnson helped create the interaction design of the final product


## Example of an introduction

- Problem
- [Product] is an industry-leading English-learning platform, but its design looks outdated compared to its competitors and parts of its user experience are unpolished. An overhaul is overdue and will ensure [Product] remains competitive in the long run.

- Solution
- We set out to create a brand-new design system to ensure [Product] encompasses best-in-class usability and aesthetics across all corners of the app.

- Role
- I led the project and worked on all aspects of the new design system, including its visual, UX and motion design. I also revamped the UX of key pages while my developer colleagues helped implement my designs.
