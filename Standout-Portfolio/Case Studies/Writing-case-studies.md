# How to write UX case studies

- Approach it like a design story
  - not just a list of tasks completed
- A narrative on you as an individual and how you think
  - don't just show the final product, show the path you took to get there
  - how you collaborate with others
  - add emotion and conflict
- Make it scannable by using headings and subheadings
- Balance I with We to acknowledge team members

## Design Story Blueprint

- Create a structure for your case studies. You have 3 main goals
  - showcase your design process and your solutions
  - keep the reader engaged as you guide them through the design projects
  - make it easy to navigate your case study


## What is a case study

- Detailed presentation of a project
  - Presents final solution
  - problems or challenges
  - research that informed decision iterations
  - not the whole design process, just parts

- Combine media and text in each section for the case study
  - 60% - 80% text and 20% - 40% media
- focus on one thing for the project 
  - what skills do you want to highlight in the project
- Always include 2 sections in the each project
  - Hook area
  - outcomes and lessons learned


## Hook area

- type of project
  - school, client, hypothetical etc
- your role in the project
  - designer, Researcher, Writer
- Your contribution
  - checkout flow, optimization, information architecture
- did you work solo or in a group
- Design approach and methodologies
  - agile, lean
- preview of the work
  - screens, videos, prototype
- Introduction(Exposition)


- Show the results of the project at the beginning
  - Whether the reader should invest in reading about the project or not
  - the positive outcomes, lessons learnt and skills you gained


## Research Area

- show you care by using research-driven, user-centered solutions
- provide context, constraints and clear research goals
- use insights to show your processes
- link your research findings and explain how they informed your problem statement and design process
- explain reasoning behind your research methodologies and what you learned from them


## Sketching and Wireframing Area

- how do you approach solutions for your users problems
- how do you collaborate in a team to generate and develop ideas
- when you face a roadblock, how do you get past it?
- Your sketches should be well presented
  - don't display illegible work


## Prototyping and Iteration area

- showcase your final designs
- include both mobile and desktop prototypes
- show usability testing and design changes you implemented based on insights you found
  - shows how you improve designs through iteration


## Outcomes and Lessons Learned

- Did the project achieve its goals?
  - if not, why? if yes, how?
- include self-reflection
  - what you have learnt to show growth and adaptability
  - even if it wasn't a success
- acknowledge your mistakes and lessons learnt
  - ability to evolve and self-improve
  

# Narrative: Design Story

## Exposition

- should be about 5 sentences
- Scene of your story: short, sweet and fit into your hook
  - project background:
    - project context
    - client or company
    - product
    - only relevant details
  - inciting incident/problem statement
    - what set the project in motion
    - instead of "My company tasked me with the project"
    - use "My company wanted to increase conversions to improve year-on-year sales figures, and identified our product pages as an opportunity for this."
  - your motivation
    - what motivated you to take the project on
    - the most important part
    - eg: "I was eager to develop my user rapport skills, and this project required a lot of qualitative research."
    - shows you're committed to grwoth and up for challenges
  - hint at the outcome
    - describe the deliverables/final output
  - Project goals
    - use measurable goals so it is clear in you conclusion whether you met them or not


## Emotion

- help reader imagine themselves in your shoes
- not dry, factual account
  - The main finding was that the assumption that users shopped based on their weekly nutritional needs was invalid.
- emotional, but professional
  - Our finding threw a giant wrench in the works. We realized our assumption—that users shopped based on their weekly nutritional needs—was completely wrong.


## Moments of conflict

- Challenges in project and how you solved them
- differing opinions in project and how to move forward
- technical limitations of product/platform that required design compromise
- conflicting stakeholder expectations
- Also show how user insights, ideas and decisions guided the project's final iterations 

## Climax

- It should be the pivotal event
- Take time to build it
- It could be a turning point, victory or failure
- It should make sense with the rest of the narrative
- eg:
  - agreement to implement a design after discussion
  - creation of design element
  - user research that explains misunderstood point
