# Steps for Design

- Questions asked by hiring managers
  - Show me how you started with an opportunity and produced real value for a user and the organization
  - I’m curious to know what isn’t in the design and why, just as much as I’d like to know why elements made it in
  - Tell me the problem you were trying to solve, your role, any constraints, project timeline, changes from iteration to iteration and how the research informed the design
    - show your work not the final poiished design
    - show some research

- Prioritize what you want to communicate
  - What are the three top things about you and your work a reader should take from your portfolio
  - what capabilities are you trying to communicate and how each person seeing your portfolio will digest it

- Make your work scannable and remove unnecessary details


## Step 1

- Showcase specialties 
  - What am I really good at?
  - What differentiates me from other people
  - On which projects did I bring the most value
  - From which projects did I learn the most
  - What interesting stories can I tell about the work I did
- Prioritize the projects for the work you're looking for
  - showcase projects where you enjoyed doing the work


## Step 2

- Choose 3-5 projects as case studies
- Quality over quantity
- Choose your best projects to showcase
  - showcase a wide variety of skill and work
- Emphasize the contributions you made to the project
- choose projects that align with the job description
- Case study should include the following information 
  - The problems you had to solve or hypotheses you came up with for solving it
    - Example: Our application got negative reviews because users weren’t receiving alerts about new sales on the site. Based on the content of the reviews,
    - we hypothesized that users were not aware that they could adjust notification settings in the application.
  - Your specific role in the project and how you collaborated with others
    - Example: I was the sole UX designer on an Agile team comprised of 3 developers, a product owner, a scrum master, and a quality engineer.
    - I was responsible for determining the overall design direction of the project, while collaborating with the rest of the team on ideation.
  - How you came to your proposed solution
    - Usability testing showed that users did not realize that they could adjust their notification settings.
    - We decided to design the notification settings to be more prominent in the site navigation
  - How your proposed solution(s) solved the problem
    - Example: We conducted additional usability testing with the same tasks and our new design, which showed an increase in findability compared to the previous round of testing.
    - Users were able to adjust their notification settings, which gave them access to new sales alerts.
  - Challenges you faced, including design concepts that were ultimately not pursued
    - Example: During ideation, we went through several different design concepts that ultimately did not completely satisfy user needs. One design concept that we prototyped displayed the notification settings in a modal when users logged in,
    - but it caused frustration because people had to close it to complete their original task.
  - How the project affected the users and the business
    - Example: Because users were now able to turn on new-sales notifications, sales increased by 15%. Our application reviews have skewed positive and customer-satisfaction survey scores have increased
  - What you learned
    - Example: Because of this project, we realized the importance of prototype testing for exploring new design concepts. It made us test new designs to make sure they were viable solutions before putting in development effort.


## Step 3

- choose your desired format
- break up texts with visuals and make a clear disctinction between projects


## Step 4

- Choose a basic template to follow to keep your work cohesive


## Step 5

- Get feedback and iterate after creating the portfolio
  - check for spelling and grammatical errors
  - confusion about content
  - overall usability of format
  - take note of what resonates with hiring managers and what is unclear
- keep track of projects and update them on your resume as you go
