# Why are designers special

- Experts take a problem and generalize it(abstract)
  - they often forget
    - the people
    - culture
    - capabilities
    - environment
  - one solution does not solve all
  - don't solve it all at once
- Some solutions create other problems 
  - political problems
  - moving people from their homes
  - it takes time to solve problems
  - real lives of real peoples are affected
- Design brings experts together
  - Design is about synthesis(doing things) not analysis
  - solve the problems on ground with the people who are being affected
  - Community-driven-design
