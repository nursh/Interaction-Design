# Let's Democratize Design

- When trying to solve problems for people
  - they might have the solution
  - understand their problems
  - acknowledge the current solutions
  - investigate the root causes of the problems and help build solutions
- Let people lead the process in improving their own lives
- Local people should lead the design process
