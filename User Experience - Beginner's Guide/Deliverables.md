# UX Deliverables

- Deliverable vary depending on role in the team
- Detach yourself from deliverables
  - focus on the work
  - focus on adaptability with your research results


- Understand the product objectives and user needs before you begin your work
  - why you are designing and for whom


## Personas

- fictional character as a user stereotype
- represents users and their:
  - goals
  - frustrations
  - motivations
  - skills
  - demographics
  - education
- as many personas as possible to empathize with users
  - and what they want to achieve


## Storyboards

- comic strip showing user's actions and circumstances under which they are performed
  - what the user does
  - how the environment is affecting how or why the user does something


## Customer journey

- A diagram that represents the steps taken by a user to meet a specific goal
- Laying out the process along a time show the designer
  - changes in a users context, motivations, problems and needs along the way
- Use to identify road blocks and see where to solve the problem


## Brainstorming

- generate ideas on how to address issues and problems from user research
- Explore all ideas and chase the most promising
- write them on sticker notes
  - group then sort them
  - and discuss


## Content Strategy

- Content to drive the traffic(users)
- Make sure the communication matches your design
- You will probably not be the one making it


## Information Architecture and Interaction Design

- usually specialists
- visualize information and interactions
  

### Sitemaps

- show hierarchy and navigation structure of a website or application
- usually for screens/sections
- how users will transition from one section to another


### User Flows(Task flow)

- diagram showing steps a user has to take with your product to achieve a goal
  - only what happens with your product
- check efficiency of process and help pinpoint how of great ideas


## Wireframes

- first interface-related deliverables in UX process
- lean layouts before final approval
  - grayscale and do not include visual or branding elements


## Prototypes

- simulation of product to build
- early version that people can interact with
- bring idea to life without investing time and energy
- test your idea with real people to identify friction points  and iterate on design
- Low fidelity prototype
  - no visual design details
  - rough idea of where to place content
- High fidelity prototype
  - pixel-perfect prototypes
  - shows design details of product
  - takes into consideration physical screen dimensions and physical device sizes
  - shown to customers or stakeholders


## Information Design

- Information can be text, and audio-visual elements
  - animated gifs
  - voice-overs
  - explainer videos


### UX Writing/Microcopy

- words people see when they interact with software, app or website
- conversation between digital product and person using it
- any text on the screen basically


## Visual Design

- The first element seen by the user
- users form first impression in 50 milliseconds
  

### Mockups

- Mockups are fully polished visual designs rendered in realistic devices
  - using branding, colors, images and typography


### Design Systems

- library of reusable components and guidelines people can combine into interfaces and interactions


## Evaluation Deliverables

- evaluate your (and your peers') work to make sure it meets users' and organizations objective
- also look at your competition
- to learn and improve your designs


### Usability Reports

- run evaluations of your design using real users
- using qualitative evaluation
  - ask users to perform specific tasks
  - measure
    - errors
    - number of clicks
    - time taken to complete task
  - using 
    - eye tracking camera etc
- A/B testing
  - offering alternative design implementations to compare them

- Evaluation
  - Background Summary 
    - what you tested, where and when, tools used and who was involved
  - Methodology
    - what tasks were performed
    - data collected
    - what scenarios were used
    - participants and demographics
  - Test Results
    - Analyses of data collected
    - illustrations of data charts
    - statistical analyses and technical details based on who the report is for
  - Findings and Recommendations
    - what do you recommend based on findings
    - what worked well and what didn't
    - What to do to improve design

- Tailor the report to the person you're presenting
  - some people need an executive summary others need the details


### Analytics Report

- Analytics data based on use by users
- used to improve usability
  - monitor user transitions and behavior in product
- contains insights from data and highlights where design should be improved
- must contain
  - data
  - plausible explanations
  - recommendations on what to do
- what impacts designs changes have had on your product after identifying issues and addressing them
