# Human-Centered Design(People centered design)

- study how people use systems
  - avoid errors
- humanity centered design
  - focus on the society on group of people not individuals
- unifying factor
  - people, society and humanity
- research, understand and interact with real users
  - researching user's context of use
  - specifying requirements(needs and problems)
  - producing design and evaluating solutions against the requirements
- Using personas
  - use real names(avoid saying users - dehumanizes)
  - promoting empathy and understanding
- Direct engagement with users
  - observation - watch users
  - research - understand context of use
    - how something is used in the real world
    - the environment of where something is used
  - evaluation - see what problems might have
    - usability testing
    - don't rely solely on evaluation(check to see if you're solving the right problem first)
- We usually miss things in design
  - some people have different needs
- process should focus on users not on evaluations
- Produce prototypes as early as possible
- timescales to allow feedback
- make your design team multi-disciplinary
  - diverse with different perspectives
- work in small steps and continuously iterate
  - don't solve everything at once
  - design and get feedback(then improve)
