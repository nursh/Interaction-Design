# What is Design Thinking and Why is it so popular?

- Design thinking is an iterative and non linear process with five phases
  - Empathize
  - Define
  - Ideate
  - Prototype
  - Test

- Design thinking is about
  - understand users(their problems and needs)
    - develop empathy
    - observe
  - challenge assumptions
    - question the problem, assumptions and implications
  - redefine problems
    - help tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown
  - create innovative solution that can be prototyped and tested
    - ongoing experimentation with new concepts and ideas
  - identify solutions that are not apparent with your initial level of understanding

- Look at fundamental issues and solve them
  - don't solve symptoms
- Don't rush to a solution
  - small & simple interventions
- Solution has to come from the people(community driven design)
  - they usually have started the solution
  - let the people lead the way

- don't look at people as numbers
  - they have emotions, driving factors, needs, motivations

- User research
  - reveal unknown parameters
  - uncover alternate strategies to build innovative solutions
  - pool experience from previous projects
  - consider present and future conditions specific to product
  - test parameters of the problem
  - test practical application of alternative problem solutions
  - analyze and falsify solutions to select best available option

- Thinking at the corners and edges of the box
  - The truck that was stuck under a bridge
    - the boy said let the air out of the tires

- Look at great designs and analyze what made them great
  - and the same for bad design
  - document things through video or photo
  - will be beneficial for design practice
