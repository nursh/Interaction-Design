# Why you should analyze your competition to design better solutions and how to do it

- Before starting a project, look at what others have done and analyze
- A UX competitive analysis report is one deliverable in the industry
- See what people have designed
  - any strengths and weaknesses
  - and what can be improved from the design
- 2 types of competition
  - direct competition(uber and lyft)
  - indirect competition(amazon online store) and google(search engine)
    - have different purpose from your product
    - but users use it to accomplish similar goals
    - in this case product search comparison


## When and why should you compare your design to others

- when? - At every opportunity
- Learn through comparison
- Why?
  - looking at what others are doing, shows you what they are not doing(or not doing well)
    - this opens up opportunities for you for better service
  - Examine how other people tackled their problems
    - useful for developing your own skills
    - and a source of inspiration
    - break down interaction and visual elements to see why they work well
    - then apply knowledge to your designs


## Competition Analysis

- Done in the early stages of design
- Identity direct competition
  - scope their weaknesses
  - and see what you can improve
  - look at new emerging competitors
    - see what they have implemented and add it to your product
- Identity indirect competition
  - look at how they do things and break it down
- Informal activities that:
  - help with keeping up with latest industry trends
  - getting inspiration for future designs and update to current ones
  - break down why something works well for some products


## Ad hoc encounters with indirect competitors

- Don't just copy designs blindly
  - might have intellectual and copyright infringement
  - might be bad for your business(only works in some context)
- Break down the factors that make designs work


## Five rules to Help form and maintain comparative mindset

- Identify the need
  - Every design is a solution to a particular need
  - How does a design help my users achieve their goal
- Identify the real competitors
- Compare through criteria not personal preference
  - use criteria to judge(good ones are by Jakob Nielsen - 10 usability heuristics)
- Blind imitation is the most certain path to failure
  - design solution is unique not only to the problem but to the users
  - remember to go through design process
    - empathize with users
    - frame your problems
    - ideate, prototype and evaluate solution under context
- There is no substitute for usability testing
  - test your design with real users
    - will reveal reasons for adopting or discarding a design
