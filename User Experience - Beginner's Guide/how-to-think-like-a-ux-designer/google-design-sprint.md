# How to do a Google Design Sprint

- Generate and validate ideas before using significant resources
- The problem
  - Teams can't predict user reaction to design
  - don't spend time developing in a silo
- The solution
  - use design sprint
  - generate, validate ideas before using resources on it
- Design sprint
  - get insights into critical business questions within a short timeframe
  - in 5 days
  - uses:
    - Rapid Design
    - Prototype development
    - user testing
  - 5 steps(linear and reiterate to evaluate)
    - Understand
    - Sketch
    - Decide
    - Prototype
    - Validate

- How to plan a design sprint
  - Write a brief
  - Conduct user research
  - who should be in design sprint
    - people from different specialization
  - suitable space for the sprint
  - Gather supplies for sketching and prototyping
  - Choose icebreaker exercise to start team

- Understand - Day 1
  - shared knowledge about business problem
  - business goals
  - insights from user research
  - overview of competitive products
  - technical opportunities
  - demonstrations of solutions

- Sketch - Day 2
  - individual effort
  - do on paper
  - break up problem into chunks 
  - get as many ideas as possible

- Decide - Day 3
  - which idea to go through to Prototype
  - Figure out if there are contradictions with goals
    - Budget
    - Users
    - Technology Capacity
    - Business Drivers
  - Refine list and remove ideas that are not feasible
  - Create user story to help with specification

- Protoype - Day 4
  - use what you're comfortable
  - Get document, review

- Validate - Day 5
  - Get end users to interact with product
  - The team should observe the users interact with the product
    - either directly or by recording the test
  - Cognitive walkthrough
  - take notes and see what you've learnt
  - Get other teams like stakeholders to review the product
  -  

- End of Design sprint
  - Efficient failure
    - lessons learnt
    - saved time
  - A flawed success
    - some ideas work
    - what to improve and remove
  - an epic win
    - ideas work
