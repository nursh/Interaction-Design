# Heuristic Evaluation(How to conduct a heuristic evaluation)

- using set of guidelines to determine if a user-interface is user-friendly
- What are heuristics?
  - simply means guidelines
  - using principles proposed by others as a guiding tool
    - eg. Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich
- It is not as effective as testing with real users
- 10 heuristics by Jakob Nielsen
  - visibility of system status eg. showing things in shopping basket
    - keep the user informed of what is happening behind the scenes
  - match between system and real world
    - eg slider and rotating slider
      - up and to the right is addition
        - down and to the left is reduction
  - user control and freedom
    - let users go back and be able to fix things
  - consistency and standards
    - use same words to represent same things across departments
    - similar language and terminology, icons etc
  - Error prevention
    - anticipate and plan for errors
    - make it easy for users to able to recover from errors
    - presenting users with errors and telling them they've done bad and should do it over is bad user experience
  - Recognition rather than recall
    - people recognize better than they can recall
  - flexibility and efficiency of use
    - design for learning vs efficiency
    - let users customize or tailor interface to suit their needs
  - Aesthetic and minimalist design
    - do not put too much in front of users
  - Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
    - avoid technical jargon
    - write error messages in plain languageJa
  - Help and Documentation

- Adapt heuristics to new technologies
  - like on voice-based smart devices - using light to indicate system status


## How to conduct a heuristic evaluation

- Document your work
- establish and appropriate list of heuristics
- select your evaluators
  - should not be end users
  - typically usability experts with domain expertise in the industry
- brief your evaluators
  - so they know what to do and cover during their evaluation
  - they can decide what to evaluate based on their expertise
- First evaluation phase
  - use product freely to gain a feel of the methods of interaction and scope
- Second evaluation phase
  - carry out run-through using applying chosen heuristics to the elements identified in the first phase
  - evaluators will look at individual elements and how well they fit in the overall design
- Record problems
  - either let the evaluators write down the problems or do it yourself
  - be as detailed as possible
- Debriefing session
  - meeting with different evaluators to collate their finding  and list all problems
  - Suggest potential solutions to problems based on the heuristics

- use about 3 to 5 evaluators

- pros
  - fast and inexpensive 
  - heuristics can highlight potential issues early in the design process

- cons
  - depends on knowledge of evaluators
  - it is base on assumptions of what good usability is(not a substitute for testing with real users)
  - can end up giving false alarms
