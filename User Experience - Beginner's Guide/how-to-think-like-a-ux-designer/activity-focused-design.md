# Activity-focused Design

- Action-focused design centers on actions people need/want to take in order to reach a goal
  - identify and design steps to reach a goal

- Activity focused design has different approaches focused on activity
  - task analysis
  - jobs to be done
  - activity theory
  - activity-based design


## Definitions

- A goal -> an end state a person intends to achieve
  - eg. light is turned on
- An activity -> series of tasks that help a person to achieve a goal
  - eg. connect lightbulb to the app
- A task -> A single unit of action or work
  - eg. open the app, click on button with lightbulb icon


## Task Analysis

- choose level of specificity
  - but don't be too specific eg. look at lightbulb, move, finger
  - don't be too general either eg. light the room, use the app
- if designing something new, avoid mentioning specific user interface elements
  - write in an interface-independent way eg. select the bulb
- if designing for something(app or system) that exists
  - include takss that describe the existing interface
  - eg. use the search box to find the device

- Design an app to control lightbulbs from your mobile device
- First step
  - determine the most important goal(s) a person is trying to achieve
    - do they want to turn lights on and off
    - control them automatically based on the time of day
    - connect them to a motion sensor
- Second step
  - determine tasks required to reach goals
    - plugging in the light bulb
    - turning on mobile device bluetooth
    - connect bulbto app
    - turning on lightbulb on the app
- Third step
  - document goals and tasks in a way that helps you and your team identify gaps or opportunities in improvement
  - can be using task analysis diagram, hierarchical task diagram, sequence diagram or flow chart
- Fourth step
  - look for unnecessary, inefficient or counterproductive tasks that could be removed or improved in your design

- Strength
  - if tasks are to be completed in a certain order
    - it helps to reveal gaps and optimization opportunities
  - focus on discrete tasks translates naturally to the design of a digital experience
    - it helps make design straightforward

- Weaknesses
  - it does not help with non-task-related aspects like emotional state of users, social pressures or norms of use
  - it can be prone to backward-looking design
    - makes it hard to imagine and design using new methods
    - 

- There are several ways to determine goals and tasks
  - think-aloud interviews
    - expressing what they are thinking while working toward a goal
  - contextual inquiry
    - observe what people do in their usual environment
  - or work towards the goal yourself
