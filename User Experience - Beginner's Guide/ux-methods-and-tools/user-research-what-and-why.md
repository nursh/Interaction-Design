# User Research: What it is and Why you should do it

- 3 common reasons for user research
  - create designs that are relevant
    - empathize with users
    - conduct interviews and observe people in context
    - useful at the beginning of the project
    - validate your ideas with prospective users(get constant feedback)
      - how they would interact with it
      - how they perceive the design
  - create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use
    - easy to use and easy to learn
    - you are the expert of your product and can become blind to what is difficult to use
    - deformation professionelle -> seeing things from the point of view from one's profession
    - test on our primary target of users frequently and as early as possible
      - from when you have primitive prototypes - paper
      - then to refined products
      - don't start testing when you have an almost finished product
  - understand the return on investment of your user experience
    - show the changes made in the design generated more sales
      - results in a large number of customers
      - made work more efficient
      - makes stakeholders invest more in UX
    - using quantitative methods like A/B testing(testing different variations of the same product)

- know your users
  - will tell you what to create and where to begin

- What is user research(design research)?
  - help to place people at the center of your design process and products
  - user research helps
    - with design inspiration
    - with solution evaluation
    - with impact measurement 

- Divided into 2
  - Quantitative
    - survey, formal experiments(such as A/B testing, tree testing)
    - measure user behavior in a way that can be quantifies and used for statistical analysis
  - Qualitative
