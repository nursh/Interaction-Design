# What is empathy

- Start design process with empathy 
- Empathy is seeing the world through other people's eyes
  - see what they see
  - feel what they feel
  - experience as they do
  - but you can't fully experience what someone else does but we can get close

- Put aside preconceived ideas of the world
  - choose to understand the ideas, thoughts and needs of others instead

- Empathy is a deep understanding of the problems and realities of the people you are designing for
  - learn people's difficulties
  - uncover their latent needs and desires to explain their behaviors
  - understand their environment and their roles and interactions with them

- Empathy helps you
  - Appreciate people's emotional and physical needs
  - Gain insight into the way people see, understand and interact with world around them
  - Realize how lives are impacted within the contexts being investigated
  - Find out what people mean rather than just what they say
    - concern with motivations and thoughts rather than facts

- Don't confuse empathy with sympathy(showing concern for the well-being of others)
- Visit your users in their natural environments
  - learn about how they behave
  - conduct interviews with them
  - so you can create a solution which helps solve a problem they face

- Empathy is the first stage of design thinking process
  - observe, engage and empathize with people you are designing for
  - understand their experience and motivation
  - immerse yourself in their physical environment to gain deeper understanding

- People ignore design that ignores people
- 3 parameters to a successful product of service
  - desirability
  - feasibility(technology exists)
  - viability(profits or business benefits may be derive)
- Try to understand what is not being said
  - develop intuition, imagination creativity
  - extract the right kinds of insight to ensure you make a meaningful difference
  - make sense of what is not being said and what is being hinted at
- Empathy is the difference between what your users say at face value and "thoughtless acts"
  - thoughtless acts are small subtle acts people exhibit that reveal how their behaviors are shaped by their environment
