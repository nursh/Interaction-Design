# Pros and Cons of Conducting User Interviews

- user interviews are a way to empathize with users
  - give in-depth understanding of users' values, perceptions and experiences
  - ask specific questions to explore users points of view
- They are usually semi-structured qualitative interviews
  - prepare a set of topics to cover during the interview
  - but still open to follow lead in the conversation(when the users say something unexpected)
- A good interview requires preparation and careful consideration from the interviewer
  - be aware of how to ask questions and how to listen to gain valid insights

- Semi-structured interviews are good at getting the why of what people do not the what
  - the what is better gotten from observations
  - They are not good for
    - when people have difficulty recalling
    - anticipating future design

- Interviews are often used with other methods(qualitative and quantitative)


## How to interview

- make them at ease(friendly welcome)
  - explain what you want from them
- get information about their lives(context questions)
  - natural conversation
  - use specific questions to learn background info
  - what they do and their habits
- introduce the prototype
  - make them feel comfortable giving candid feedback
  - make sure the user doesn't feel tested
- tasks
  - give the customer tasks to do
  - encourage them to think aloud
  - what terms mean to them
- quick debrief
  - what the user thinks of it



## Uses of interview

- For exploration
  - used in the exploration phase of a design project
  - get information and understanding of your potential users and various aspects of their lives that are of interest in the project
  - Context is important to understand different use cases
    - where the product is used
  - They form basis for personas, scenarios

- In combination with usability testing and formal experiments
  - controlled experiments usually measure things like:
    - how many errors a user performs
    - how long it takes to complete a task
  - interviews are used to evaluate user's experience
    - like a rating scale. eg on a scale of 1-5, how easy was it to locate a certain feature
    - useful for collating data
  - Follow up interview after performing tasks
    - like reason behind the user's actions and experience
    - why they liked or disliked certain features
    - why they performed unexpected actions

- concept exploration
  - useful for exploring concept ideas early in the development process
  - show the users illustrations and obtain feedback
  - ask the users about the problems and desires in relation to problem space
    - avoid asking them to evaluate specific solutions
  - ask your users how the do things(define problem space)
    - don't explain to them your concept of doing things
    - this helps with collecting valuable information without asking directly what they think of your idea

- in combination with observations
  - observation of user's actions and context are combined with interviews
  - conducting interviews in context show how users to something
  - to get how users do things(contextual inquiry)
    - don't ask them
    - tell them to show you
    - ask them questions as you observe them interact with the product or perform activity
    - or let them explain their interaction as if explaining to a novice user
